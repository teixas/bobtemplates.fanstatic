js.{{{ library.name }}}
{{{ '*' * library.name|count }}}

Introduction
============

This library packages `{{{ library.name }}}`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`{{{ library.name }}}`: {{{ library.url }}}

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.{{{ library.name }}}``) are published to some URL.
